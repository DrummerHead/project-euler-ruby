# This one does calculations like crazy. I was drunk and not actually
# trying to resolve it but to see what the number was. I guess it works?
#
# Something I've found about myself is that it appears I first want to
# map out the universe, and after I have that mapped out I go and solve the
# little thing that was requested, instead of just using the constrains
# or instructions given by the problem to jump straight ahead to just getting
# the damn number instead of doing so much other stuff.
