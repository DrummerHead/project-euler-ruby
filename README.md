# Project Euler problems

This is based on [these problems](http://projecteuler.net/problems) and then checked with [projecteuler-solutions](http://code.google.com/p/projecteuler-solutions/wiki/ProjectEulerSolutions)

Just for fun, done in Ruby since I'm trying to be better at it.

Done in such a way for you to run the file in the console to see the solution.

Love ya'all humans!
